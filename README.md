# UFOs
## Purpose
The client requested a website that would display the UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted site users the ability to filter by multiple criteria. The table will display the data from the filter criteria. The table was created using JavaScript and HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website

## Results
Welcome to UFO Sightings: Homescreen

Search Filter: You can search using all or some of the filter options available on the screen. Make sure to type all things in lower case as that is how the data was provided. Press enter to initiate the filter.

## Summary
The user must know specific dates, cities, states, countries or shapes to search for a UFO sighting. Not all the shapes are obvious shapes, such as light. In addition, all the criteria require lower case letters and cannot have any spaces at the end of the search. The only acceptable option for the criteria is to be entered exactly as it is shown in the data. I have two recommendations that will better enhance the website:
1. The filters should include a trim option to remove the extra space at the end if someone happens to make this mistake.
2. A filter for a date range instead of just one date would allow people to search for UFO data over a period of time. This allows more data to be pulled instead of having to choose the exact date of the sighting.
